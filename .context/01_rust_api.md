# What is this about?

This doc is a place to collect ideas and feedback on what the shape of the rust API should look like for the Flutter app. Currently the rust crate that is built into Tauri is doing a lot of things that I don't think we need to do here in Flutter. For example, there are about 50 commands that are quite Tuari or Svelte specific and I think we can get away from that and do something cleaner here.

# Why do we have a Rust crate in the app at all?

White Noise is implementing [NIP-EE](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1427/files) to bring highly secure messaging (based on the MLS protocol) to Nostr. The main implementation of the MLS protocol is [OpenMLS](https://github.com/openmls/openmls) which is written in Rust. We also wrote a set of [rust crates](https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr/tree/master/crates/nostr-mls) that wrap OpenMLS and provide the extra functionality required to make MLS function on Nostr. Because these crates are well tested and Rust is highly performant and type/memory safe, we'd like to continue using these crates to provide the core functionality to our apps. This also means that we're front-end independent. Want to drive White Noise via a CLI? We can do that. Want to use the crate to build a website? We can do that.

# How does the Flutter app talk to the Rust crate?

We're using [flutter_rust_bridge](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge) to automatically generate bindings from our rust code to this app.

# Application State

Since we'll be using Riverpod to create high-level providers that give access global state, we should be able to simplify the API significantly and depend on a high-level `StreamProvider` (or several) that provide updates from the backend to the front-end continuously.

# Structs

## Whitenoise

```rust
struct WhitenoiseState {
    config: WhitenoiseConfig,           // The config object passed in to initialize Whitenoise
    accounts: Vec<Account>,             // Vec of accounts that are signed in
    active_account: Option<PublicKey>,  // Optional in case there is no signed in accounts
}
```

## Accounts

```rust
struct Account {
    pubkey:             PublicKey,          // Nostr public key - in hex format
    metadata:           Metadata,           // Kind-0 metadata of a user
    settings:           AccountSettings,    // White Noise specific app preferences
    onboarding:         AccountOnboarding,  // White Noise specific onboarding steps
    relays:             AccountRelays,      // Nostr relays
    nwc:                AccountNwc,         // Nostr Wallet Connect settings and data
    contacts:           Vec<PublicKey>,     // Set of pubkeys of the user's contacts (from their kind 3 event)
    last_used:          Timestamp,          // The last time the account was used
    last_synced:        Timestamp,          // The last time the account was synced up fully to relays
    active:             bool,               // Is this account currently active - (do we need this?)
    groups:             Vec<Group>,         // Group for the groups the user is part of (includes both active and inactive groups)
    welcomes:           Vec<Welcome>,       // Welcomes for the user (includes pending, accepted, and dismissed welcomes)
}
```

```rust
struct Contact {
    pubkey:     PublicKey,      // Nostr public key - in hex format
    alias:      String          // Contact's alias (petname); this is a NIP-02 concept, set by the user following this contact
    metadata:   Metadata,       // Kind-0 metadata
    relays:     AccountRelays,  // Nostr relays
}
```

```rust
struct Metadata {
    name:         Option<String>,    // Name
    display_name: Option<String>,    // Display name (always show this first, fallback to name)
    about:        Option<String>,    // Bio

    banner:       Option<String>,    // Banner image URL
    nip05:        Option<String>,    // NIP-05 verification
    lud06:        Option<String>,    // LUD-06 lightning URL - rarely used
    lud16:        Option<String>,    // LUD-16 lightning URL
    // Other custom fields can also show up here, always of the Option<String> type
}
```

```rust
struct AccountSettings {
    dark_theme:    bool,    // Dark mode
    dev_mode:      bool,    // Dev mode
    lockdown_mode: bool,    // Lockdown mode (doesn't currently do anything)
}
```

```rust
struct AccountOnboarding {
    inbox_relays:        bool,    // Do they have an inbox relays list event (kind: 10050)
    key_package_relays:  bool,    // Do they have a key package relays list event (kind: 10051)
    publish_key_package: bool,    // Have they published a key package
}
```

```rust
struct AccountRelays {
    nostr_relays:       Vec<RelayUrl>,  // List of user's normal relays from kind: 10002 event
    inbox_relays:       Vec<RelayUrl>,  // List of user's inbox relays from kind: 10050 event
    key_package_relays: Vec<RelayUrl>,  // List of user's key package relays from kind: 10051 event
}
```

```rust
/// Status of a relay connection - matches RelayStatus from rust-nostr
enum RelayStatus {
    Initialized     // The relay has just been created.
    Pending         // The relay will try to connect shortly.
    Connecting,     // Trying to connect.
    Connected,      // Connected.
    Disconnected,   // The connection failed, but another attempt will occur soon.
    Terminated,     // The connection has been terminated and no retry will occur.
    Banned,         // The relay has been banned.
}
```

```rust
struct AccountNwc {
    nwc_uri: String // The NWC connection URI
    balance: u64    // The NWC balance
}
```

## Groups

```rust
/// High level details about a group. Messages are loaded separately via pagination.
struct Group {
    mls_group_id:         GroupId,           // The MLS Group ID - never changes
    nostr_group_id:       [u8; 32],          // The group ID used for identifying this group on relays - can change
    name:                 String,            // The name of the group
    description:          String,            // The description of the group

```

```rust
enum GroupType {
    DirectMessage,  // Just two members
    Group           // More than two members
}
```

```rust
enum GroupState {
    Active,     // The group is active
    Inactive,   // The group is inactive, e.g. users have left or when welcome has been declined

    Pending,    // The welcome is pending
    Accepted,   // The welcome was accepted
    Declined,   // The welcome was declined
    Ignored,    // The welcome was ignored

## Files

```rust
struct FileUpload {
    pub filename:   String,

struct UploadedMedia {
    pub blob_descriptor:    BlobDescriptor,
