  **White Noise: The Identity-Free Messenger for Private, Censorship-Resistant Communication**

  In a world where every message is tracked, White Noise offers a refuge. Built on the decentralized Nostr network and fortified with cutting-edge MLS encryption, it's the first messenger that's *truly* private, fast, and scalable—no phone numbers, no emails, and no central authority.

  **Why You Need It:**
  - **Private by Design:** End-to-end encryption with forward secrecy and post-compromise security—your messages stay hidden, even if keys leak.
  - **No Censorship. Ever.** Thousands of independent relays keep conversations flowing, no matter the pressure. Run your own or use trusted nodes.
  - **Identity Freedom:** Choose anonymity, a pseudonym, or your real name. Your data, your rules.
  - **Scale Without Limits:** From one-on-one chats to groups with thousands, White Noise stays fast, secure, and seamless.
  - **Open Source & Community-Driven:** Built transparently for trust and security. Everyone can inspect the code, verify claims, and contribute improvements. No backdoors, no corporate control, just a free, open tool for everyone.
