# metadata cache root_cause hodlbod kind:0
**METADATA MIXUP ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED**:
- npub1nmt6ctq704tpd3weesj3yagz8a75yxs0erqsmmu7f84qlvucdtjq7xeuyf has NO kind:0 metadata event on relays
- npub1jlrs53pkdfjnts29kveljul2sm0actt6n8dxrrzqcersttvcuv3qdjynqn has correct hodlbod metadata on relays  
- The missing metadata issue causes the cache to return stale/incorrect data when no relay response is received
- Need to implement proper 'no metadata found' vs 'cached metadata' handling in MetadataCacheProvider
- This explains why both npubs show "hodlbod" - the first npub has no metadata so it's inheriting cached data from the second npub
