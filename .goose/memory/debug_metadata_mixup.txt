# debugging metadata-mixup logging
Added comprehensive debugging to metadata caching system to trace the contact mix-up issue:

**Problem**: Different npubs showing same name/avatar (not duplicates, but incorrect metadata association)

**Debugging Added**:

1. **ContactsProvider (`loadContacts` method)**:
   - Step-by-step logging of PublicKey to npub conversion
   - Individual contact processing with validation
   - Key mismatch detection and correction
   - Duplicate name detection across different npubs
   - Final contact list validation

2. **MetadataCacheProvider**:
   - Detailed logging in `getContactModel`, `_fetchMetadataForKey` 
   - Cache hit/miss tracking
   - Key normalization and standardization steps
   - Metadata fetching process from network
   - ContactModel creation and validation

**Key Changes**:
- Added `ðŸ”¥ KEY MISMATCH!` detection when contact model has wrong public key
- Automatic correction of mismatched keys
- `ðŸš¨ DUPLICATE NAME DETECTED` warnings
- Emoji-prefixed logs for easy identification

**To Debug**: 
1. Run app and load contacts
2. Look for log messages with ðŸ”¥, ðŸš¨, and other emoji prefixes
3. Check if same metadata is being returned for different npubs
4. Verify cache keys are correct and not colliding

The extensive logging will help pinpoint exactly where the metadata cross-contamination is happening.
