# debug metadata validation null_check
**ENHANCED METADATA DEBUGGING ADDED**:
- Added critical validation in _fetchMetadataForKey() that checks if NULL metadata is properly handled
- Added ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL BUG detection when null metadata results in wrong contact name
- Enhanced logging to clearly distinguish between NULL and NON-NULL fetchMetadata results  
- Added automatic correction for metadata contamination
- Added ðŸš¨ NULL METADATA logging for npubs with no kind:0 events
- This will help pinpoint if the issue is in Rust layer (returning wrong data) vs Dart layer (processing error)
